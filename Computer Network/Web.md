## Study Note ✍️

Web

- The web is one application running on top of the internet, allowing us to get web pages.

HTTP

- Hypertext Transfer Protocol, governs how web browsers and web servers communicate within TCP/IP packets
- Two commands supported by HTTP include GET and POST. GET allows a browser to ask for a page or file, and POST allows a browser to send data *to* the server.

HTTP Status code

URL

- web address, might look like https://www.example.com/
- https is the protocol being used, and in this case HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, ensuring that the contents of packets between the browser and server are encrypted.
- example.com is the domain name, where .com is the top-level domain, conventionally indicating the “type” of website, like a commercial website for .com, or an organization for .org. 
- www is the hostname that, by convention, indicates to us that this is a “world wide web” service. It’s not required, so today many websites aren’t configured to include it.
- Finally, the / at the end is a request for the default file, like index.html, that the web server will respond with.
