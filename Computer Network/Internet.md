## Study Note ‚úçÔ∏è

### Internet

- Internet is the network of networks of computers communicating with one another, which provides the infrastructure to send zeros and ones. On top of that foundation, we can build applications that send and receive data.

### Routers

- Routers are specialized computers, with CPUs and memory, whose purpose is to relay data across cables or wireless technologies, between other devices on the internet.

### Protocols

- Protocols are a set of standard conventions, like a physical handshake, that the world has agreed upon for computers to communicate with. For example, there are certain patterns of zeros and ones, or messages, a computer has to use to tell a router where it wants to send data.

### TCP/IP

- TCP/IP are two protocols for sending data between two computers. In the real world, we might write an address on an envelope in order to send a letter to someone, along with our own address for a letter in return. The digital version of an envelope, or a message with from and to addresses, is called a **packet**.

### IP

- IP stands for internet protocol, a protocol supported by modern computers‚Äô software, which includes a standard way for computers to address each other

### TCP

- transmission control protocol, is one final protocol that allows a single server, at the same IP address, to provide multiple services through the use of a port number, a small integer added to the IP address
- TCP also provides a mechanism for resending packets if a packet is somehow lost and not received. It turns out that, on the internet, there are multiple paths for a packet to be sent since there are lots of routers that are interconnected

### Net neutrality

- refers to the idea that these public routers treat packets equally, as opposed to allowing packets from certain companies or of certain types to be prioritized

### DNS

- service to translate domain name to IP addresses
