Structured Query Language 

- can interact with many relational databases and their **tables**

CRUD

- Create
- Read
- Update
- Delete

Relational database

- Programs that store data, ultimately in files, but with additional data structures that allow us to search and store data more efficiently.

  - Data uses Schemas

  - Relations

  - Data is distributed across multiple tables

  - Horizontal scaling is difficult

  - Vertical Scaling is possible
  - Limitations for lots of read & write queries per second

- Table

- Primary Key and Foreign Key

SQL commands

- `CREATE`, `INSERT`
- `SELECT`
- `UPDATE`
- `DELETE`

SQL functions

- `AVG`
- `COUNT`
- `DISTINCT`
- `LOWER`
- `MAX`
- `MIN`
- `UPPER`

SQL clauses

- `WHERE`
- `LIKE`
- `ORDER BY`
- `LIMIT`
- `GROUP BY`
