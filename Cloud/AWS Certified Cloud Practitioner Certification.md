## Study Note ‚úçÔ∏è

### Client-server model

- In computing, a client can be a web browser or desktop application that a person interacts with to make requests to computer servers. A server can be services such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), a type of virtual server.

### Cloud computing

- The on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing

### Deployment models

- Cloud-based Deployment
- On-premises Deployment
- Hybrid Deployment

### Benefits of cloud computing

- Trade upfront expense for variable expense
- Stop spending money to run and maintain data centers
- Stop guessing capacity
- Benefit from massive economies of scale
- Increase speed and agility

### AWS Services

- AWS EC2
  - provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud as Amazon EC2 instances.
- Elastic Load Balancing
  - automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

- AWS SQS
  - message queuing service
- AWS SNS
  - Using Amazon SNS topics, a publisher publishes messages to subscribers.
- AWS ECS
  - a highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS.
- AWS EKS
- AWS Fargate
- AWS Lambda
  - a service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers.
- Amazon EBS
  - a service that provides block-level storage volumes that you can use with Amazon EC2 instances. If you stop or terminate an Amazon EC2 instance, all the data on the attached EBS volume remains available.
  - An Amazon EBS volume stores data in a single Availability Zone.
  - To attach an Amazon EC2 instance to an EBS volume, both the Amazon EC2 instance and the EBS volume must reside within the same Availability Zone.
- Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
  - a service that provides object-level storage. Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.
- Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)
  - It stores data in and across multiple Availability Zones.
  - The duplicate storage enables you to access data concurrently from all the Availability Zones in the Region where a file system is located. Additionally, on-premises servers can access Amazon EFS using AWS Direct Connect.

- Amazon Relational Database Service
  - service that enables you to run relational databases in the AWS Cloud.
- Amazon DynamoDB
  - a key-value database service. It delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale.
  - DynamoDB is serverless, which means that you do not have to provision, patch, or manage servers.
  - As the size of your database shrinks or grows, DynamoDB automatically scales to adjust for changes in capacity while maintaining consistent performance.
- Amazon Redshift
  - a data warehousing service that you can use for big data analytics. It offers the ability to collect data from many sources and helps you to understand relationships and trends across your data.

- AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)
  - enables you to migrate relational databases, nonrelational databases, and other types of data stores. With AWS DMS, you move data between a source database and a target database.
