### Scrum

#### Scrum Events

The Sprint

- Sprint Planning

  - Why is this Sprint valuable?

  - What can be Done this Sprint?

  - How will the chosen work get done?

- Daily Scrums

  - The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.

- Sprint Review

  - The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.

- Sprint Retrospective

  - The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness.

#### Scrum Artifacts

- ### Product Backlog

  - The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

- ### Sprint Backlog

  - The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

- ### Increment

  - An Increment is a concrete stepping stone toward the Product Goal. Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable.
