## How to ask good questions

- ### Use meaningful, specific subject headers

  - One good convention for subject headers, used by many tech support organizations, is “object - deviation”. The “object” part specifies what thing or group of things is having a problem, and the “deviation” part describes the deviation from expected behavior.
    - Stupid: HELP! Video doesn't work properly on my laptop!
    - Smart: X.org 6.8.1 mouse cursor on Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset - is misshapen

- ### Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language

- ### Be precise and informative about your problem

  - Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.
  - Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: “Fedora Core 7”, “Slackware 9.1”, etc.).
  - Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.
  - Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.
  - Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.
  - If at all possible, provide a way to *reproduce the problem in a controlled environment*.

- ### Don't rush to claim that you have found a bug

- ### Grovelling is not a substitute for doing your homework

  - Don't waste your time, or ours, on crude primate politics. Instead, present the background facts and your question as clearly as you can. That is a better way to position yourself than by grovelling.

- ### Describe the problem's symptoms, not your guesses

  - Stupid: I'm getting back-to-back SIG11 errors on kernel compiles, and suspect a hairline crack on one of the motherboard traces. What's the best way to check for those?
  - Smart: My home-built K6/233 on an FIC-PA2007 motherboard (VIA Apollo VP2 chipset) with 256MB Corsair PC133 SDRAM starts getting frequent SIG11 errors about 20 minutes after power-on during the course of kernel compiles, but never in the first 20 minutes. Rebooting doesn't restart the clock, but powering down overnight does. Swapping out all RAM didn't help. The relevant part of a typical compile session log follows.

- ### Describe the goal, not the step

  - Stupid: How do I get the color-picker on the FooDraw program to take a hexadecimal RGB value?
  - Smart: I'm trying to replace the color table on an image with values of my choosing. Right now the only way I can see to do this is by editing each table slot, but I can't get FooDraw's color picker to take a hexadecimal RGB value.

- ### Follow up with a brief note on the solution



## How to report a bug

- The first aim of a bug report is to let the programmer see the failure with their own eyes
  - If you can't be with them to make it fail in front of them, give them detailed instructions so that they can make it fail for themselves.
- The second aim of a bug report is to describe what went wrong
  - Describe everything in detail
  - State what you saw, and also state what you expected to see
  - Write down the error messages, *especially* if they have numbers in

- Providing your own diagnosis might be helpful sometimes, but always state the symptoms
  - The diagnosis is an optional extra, and not an alternative to giving the symptoms. Equally, sending a modification to the code to fix the problem is a useful addition to a bug report but not an adequate substitute for one.

- Write clearly
- *Be precise*
