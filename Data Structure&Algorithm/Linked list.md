## Study Note ✍️

What is linked list

- A sequential list of nodes that hold data which point to other nodes also containing data

Type

- Singly LinkedList
  - Pros: use less memory and simpler implementation
  - Cons: can not easily access previous elements
- Doubly LinkedList
  - Pros: can be traversed backwards
  - Cons: take 2 times memory

Complexity

Advantage

- Dynamic data structure
- Insertion and deletion of nodes is easy
- No/low memory waste

Disadvantage

- greater memory usage - additional pointer
- no random access of elements
- accessing/searching elements is more time consuming
