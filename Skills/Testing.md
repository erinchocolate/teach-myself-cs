# Testing

## Study Note ✍️

Unit Testing

- The “Unit” part of Unit Testing comes from the idea that you can break your program down into units, or the smallest testable part of an application.

- Unit Testing enforces good code structure (each method should only do “One Thing”), and allows you to consider all of the edge cases for each method and test for them individually.

Integration Testing

Test-Driven Development(TDD)

- TDD is a development process in which we write tests for code before writing the code itself
  - Identify a new feature.
  - Write a unit test for that feature.
  - Run the test. It should fail.
  - Write code that passes the test. Yay!
  - Optional: refactor code to make it faster, cleaner, etc. Except now we have a reference to tests that should pass.
