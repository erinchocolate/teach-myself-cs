## Study Note ✍️

### **Structural UML diagrams**

Class Diagram - class

- Classes within a system, attributes and operations and the relationship between each class. Classes are grouped together to create class diagrams when diagramming large systems.

Component Diagram

- Displays the structural relationship of software system elements, most often employed when working with complex systems with multiple components. Components communicate using interfaces.

Composite Structure Diagram

- Composite structure diagrams are used to show the internal structure of a class.

Deployment Diagram

- Illustrates system hardware and its software. Useful when a software solution is deployed across multiple machines with unique configurations.

Object Diagram

- Shows the relationship between objects using real world examples and illustrates how a system will look at any given time. Because data is available within objects, they can be used to clarify relationships between objects.

Package Diagram

- There are two special types of dependencies defined between packages: package import and package merge. Packages can represent the different levels of a system to reveal the architecture. Package dependencies can be marked to show the communication mechanism between levels.

### **Behavioral UML diagrams**

Communication Diagram - object

- Similar to sequence diagrams, but the focus is on messages passed between objects. The same information can be represented using a sequence diagram and different objects.

Sequence Diagram - object

- Shows how objects interact with each other and the order of occurrence. They represent interactions for a particular scenario.

Timing Diagram

- Like Sequence Diagrams, the behavior of objects in a given time frame are represented. If there is a single object, the diagram is simple. With more than one object, interactions of objects are shown during that particular time frame.

State Machine Diagram - object

- Similar to activity diagrams, they describe the behavior of objects that behave in varying ways in their current state.

Interaction Overview Diagram

- There are seven types of interaction diagrams, and this diagram shows the sequence in which they act.

Use Case Diagram

- Represents a particular functionality of a system, created to illustrate how functionalities relate and their internal/external controllers (actors).

Activity Diagram

- Graphically represented business or operational workflows to show the **activity** of any part or component in the system. Activity diagrams are used as an alternative to State Machine diagrams.
