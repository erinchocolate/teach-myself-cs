### Minecraft Server

How to transfer files from local linux to server?

- In Unix, you can use [SCP (the scp command)](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+transfer+file+from+local+to+remote+server+linux&oq=how+to+t&aqs=chrome.0.69i59l2j69i57j0i512l2j69i60l3.2836j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)to securely copy files and directories between remote hosts without starting an FTP session or logging into the remote systems explicitly. The scp command uses SSH to transfer data, so it requires a password or passphrase for authentication.
