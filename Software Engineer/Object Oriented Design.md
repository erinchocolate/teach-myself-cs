## Study Note ‚úçÔ∏è

### OO Principle

- Encapsulation
  - getter and setter
- Abstraction
  - hide low level of implementation
- Inheritance
  - decrease duplicate code by creating super and subclass
- Polymorphism
  - subclass overwrites methods from superclass

### Solid Principle

- Single Responsibility
  - Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality
- Open Closed
  - Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features
- Liskov Substitution
  - This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class

- Interface Segregation
  - Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can not do
  - Large interfaces should be divided into small ones
- Dependency Inversion
  - Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions
